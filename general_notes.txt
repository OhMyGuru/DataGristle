1.  determine:
    - field types                         - done
    - format consistency
    - field min & max values              - done
    - field names                         - done
    - field 
    - field correlations
    - field histogram                     - done
    - file web page?
    - find invalid characters
    - find inconsistent code sets
    - find required vs optional fields
    - shallow determinator vs deep-determinator

2.  metadata
    - allow use of yaml (decentralized) or central repository
    - generate metadata

3.  what it isn't
    - enterprise ETL tool

4.  other markup languages:
    - xml
      - consider mapping each field as an xpath in regular metadata database
    - yaml
    - json

5.  misc
    - licensing
    - copyright
    - readme
    - setup tools
    - testing for various versions of python

6.  histogrammer
    - automatic bucketing:
      - integers:    
        - min & max range calculation - then determine buckets from that
      - dates & times
        - min & max range calculation
      - strings
        - sort file - take most common?
        - change to all lower case?
        - truncate?
        - hash?
