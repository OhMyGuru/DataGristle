Description: Gristle is a toolbox of tough and flexible data connectors and analyzers.  
        It's kind of an interactive mix between ETL and data analysis optimized for 
        rapid analysis and manipulation of a wide variety of data.
        
        This is substantially different from pure ETL tools - that are intended to be 
        used *after* substantial data analysis has identified all transformation 
        requirements.  It's likewise different from pure analysis tools - that 
        generally require initial data transformation, mapping and definitions and 
        have more open-ended features that distract from fundamental analysis needs.
        
        Gristle occupies a space between these tools where quick & simple 
        transformation & analysis are necessary in order to work with the large numbers
        of datasets available today.
        
        
        Current Status:  automatic identification of file delimiters, field types and 
        characteristics - produces a strong initial dataset analysis.
        
        Next Steps:  
           * finalize names
           * README markdown
           * attractive PDF output of gristle_determinator.py
           * metadata database population
        
        Its objectives include:
           * multi-platform (linux, mac os, windows)
           * multi-language (primarily python)
           * free - no cripple-licensing
           * primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical analysts
           * primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical desktop
             or eclipse
           * extensible
           * allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis
        
        DEPENDENCIES
           * Python 2.6
        
        EXISTING UTILITIES:
           * gristle_determinator.py 
               - Identifies file formats, generates metadata, prints file analysis report
               - Status:  98% complete
               - Next:    Dislay field type consistency metric
           * gristle_record_viewer.py
               - Shows one record from a file at a time - formatted based on metadata. 
               - Status:  98% complete
               - Next:    Display indicators to the right of the field values to show
                 how typical or unusual those values are.  Consider file navigation
                 commands.
        
        FUTURE UTILITIES:
           * gristle_metadata.py 
               - Manages metadata - allows users to query, add, update, delete
                 file, field, transformation, reporting descriptions.
           * gristle_transformer.py
               - Converts a file into a new format.
               - Conversions include compression, delimited/fixed-length, delimiter, 
                 string quoting, etc
           * gristle_generator
               - Generates test data based on gristle metadata
           * gristle_validator 
               - Confirms validity of database and file structure and contents.
           * gristle_file_differ.py
               - Compares two structured files and writes out the differences.
           * gristle_file_joiner.py
               - joins two files on their common keys and produces a new file
           * gristle_file_aggregator.py
               - reads a file, aggregates on a given set of fields, produces a new file
           * gristle_db_loader.py 
               - loads a file into a database
           * gristle_db_extractor.py 
               - extracts data from a database into a file
