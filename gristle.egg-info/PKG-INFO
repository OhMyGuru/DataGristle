Description: Datagristle is a toolbox of tough and flexible data connectors and analyzers.  
        It's kind of an interactive mix between ETL and data analysis optimized for 
        rapid analysis and manipulation of a wide variety of data.
        
        It's neither an enterprise ETL tool, nor an enterprise analysis, reporting, 
        or data mining tool.  It's intended to be an easily-adopted tool for technical
        analysts that combines the most useful subset of data transformation and 
        analysis capabilities necessary to do 80% of the work.  Its open source python
        codebase allows it to be easily extended to with custom code to handle that
        always challenging last 20%.
        
        
        Current Status:  Strong support for easy analysis and simple transformations of
        csv files. 
        
        Next Steps:  
           * README markdown
           * attractive PDF output of gristle_determinator.py
           * metadata database population
        
        Its objectives include:
           * multi-platform (unix, linux, mac os, windows) 
           * multi-language (primarily python)
           * free - no cripple-licensing
           * primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical analysts
           * primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical desktop
             or eclipse
           * extensible
           * allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis
           * can quickly perform initial data analysis prior to longer-duration, deeper
             analysis with heavier-weight tools.
        
        DEPENDENCIES
           * Python 2.6
        
        EXISTING UTILITIES (in descending order of maturity):
           * gristle_determinator.py 
               - Identifies file formats, generates metadata, prints file analysis report
               - This is the most mature - and also used by the other utilities so that 
                 you generally do not need to enter file structure info.
           * gristle_slicer.py
               - Used to extract a subset of columns and rows out of an input file.
               - Very mature.
           * gristle_diff.py
               - Shows differences between two files
               - Mostly mature.
           * gristle_viewer.py
               - Shows one record from a file at a time - formatted based on metadata. 
               - Mostly mature.
           * gristle_file_converter.py
               - Converts a csv from one dialect to another.  Can handle multi-character
                 field delimiters as well as record delimiters.
               - Slightly mature.
           * gristle_filter.py 
               - Applies simple filter logic to file.
               - Immature.
           * gristle_scalar.py
               - Performs scalar operations (min, max, avg, count unique, etc) on a file
               - Very simplistic .
           * gristle_graphviz_generator.py
               - Generates a graphiz dot file based upon an input file and command-line
                 preferences.
               - Really just a child.
        
        FUTURE UTILITIES:
           * gristle_metadata.py 
               - Manages metadata - allows users to query, add, update, delete
                 file, field, transformation, reporting descriptions.
           * gristle_generator
               - Generates test data based on gristle metadata
           * gristle_validator 
               - Confirms validity of database and file structure and contents.
           * gristle_file_joiner.py
               - joins two files on their common keys and produces a new file
           * gristle_grouper.py
               - reads a file, aggregates on a given set of fields, produces a new file
           * gristle_db_loader.py 
               - loads a file into a database
           * gristle_db_extractor.py 
               - extracts data from a database into a file
           * gristle_field_merge.py 
               - prints the matched values from multiple files side by side along with counts
