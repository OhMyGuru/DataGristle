DataGristle is a toolbox of tough and flexible data connectors and analyzers.  
It's kind of an interactive mix between ETL and data analysis optimized for 
rapid analysis and manipulation of a wide variety of data.

This is substantially different from pure ETL tools - that are intended to be 
used *after* substantial data analysis has identified all transformation 
requirements.  It's likewise different from pure analysis tools - that 
generally require initial data transformation, mapping and definitions and have more open-ended features that distract from fundamental analysis needs.

DataGristle occupies a space between these tools where quick & simple 
transformation & analysis are necessary in order to work with the large numbers
of datasets available today.


Current Status:  automatic identification of file delimiters, field types and 
characteristics - produces a strong initial dataset analysis.

Its objectives include:
   * multi-platform (linux, mac os, windows)
   * multi-language (primarily python)
   * free - no cripple-licensing
   * primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical analysts
   * primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical desktop
     or eclipse
   * extensible
   * allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis

DEPENDENCIES
   * Python 2.6

COMPONENTS
   * file_determinator.py 
       - identifies file formats, generates metadata
       - status:  90% complete
   * field_determinator.py 
       - identifies field formats, generates metadata
       - status:  80% complete

       - manages metadata
   * file_converter 
       - converts a file into a new format
       - conversions include compression, delimited/fixed-length, delimiter, 
         string quoting, etc
   * file_validator 
       - confirms validity of file format & contents
   * file_differ
       - compares two structured files and report to writes out the differences
   * file_joiner
       - joins two files on their common keys and produces a new file
   * file_aggregator
       - reads a file, aggregates on a given set of fields, produces a new file
   * file_misc
       - misc file utiltities, including:
           - file-name parsing
   * db_validator 
       - confirms validity of database contents
   * db_loader.py 
       - loads a file into a database
   * db_extractor.py 
       - extracts data from a database into a file
   * process_misc
       - manages audit data (process & business rule)
       - assigns run_ids
       - tracks all files
   * analysis_misc
     - place-holder for misc analysis functions like:
         - histogram
         - histogram-comparison
         - aggregation
         - uniqueness
