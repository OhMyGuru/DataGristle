Gristle is a toolbox of tough and flexible data connectors and analyzers.  
It's kind of an interactive mix between ETL and data analysis optimized for 
rapid analysis and manipulation of a wide variety of data.

This is substantially different from pure ETL tools - that are intended to be 
used *after* substantial data analysis has identified all transformation 
requirements.  It's likewise different from pure analysis tools - that 
generally require initial data transformation, mapping and definitions and 
have more open-ended features that distract from fundamental analysis needs.

Gristle occupies a space between these tools where quick & simple 
transformation & analysis are necessary in order to work with the large numbers
of datasets available today.


Current Status:  automatic identification of file delimiters, field types and 
characteristics - produces a strong initial dataset analysis.

Next Steps:  
   * finalize names
   * README markdown
   * attractive PDF output of gristle_determinator.py
   * metadata database population

Its objectives include:
   * multi-platform (linux, mac os, windows)
   * multi-language (primarily python)
   * free - no cripple-licensing
   * primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical analysts
   * primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical desktop
     or eclipse
   * extensible
   * allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis

DEPENDENCIES
   * Python 2.6

EXISTING UTILITIES:
   * gristle_determinator.py 
       - Identifies file formats, generates metadata, prints file analysis report
       - Status:  98% complete
       - Next:    Dislay field type consistency metric
   * gristle_record_viewer.py
       - Shows one record from a file at a time - formatted based on metadata. 
       - Status:  98% complete
       - Next:    Display indicators to the right of the field values to show
         how typical or unusual those values are.  Consider file navigation
         commands.

FUTURE UTILITIES:
   * gristle_metadata.py 
       - Manages metadata - allows users to query, add, update, delete
         file, field, transformation, reporting descriptions.
   * gristle_transformer.py
       - Converts a file into a new format.
       - Conversions include compression, delimited/fixed-length, delimiter, 
         string quoting, etc
   * gristle_generator
       - Generates test data based on gristle metadata
   * gristle_validator 
       - Confirms validity of database and file structure and contents.
   * gristle_file_differ.py
       - Compares two structured files and writes out the differences.
   * gristle_file_joiner.py
       - joins two files on their common keys and produces a new file
   * gristle_file_aggregator.py
       - reads a file, aggregates on a given set of fields, produces a new file
   * gristle_db_loader.py 
       - loads a file into a database
   * gristle_db_extractor.py 
       - extracts data from a database into a file
