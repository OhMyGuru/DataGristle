Gristle is a tough and flexible data connection and analysis set of libraries and utilities.

Its objectives include:
   * multi-platform (linux, mac os, windows)
   * multi-language (primarily python)
   * free - no cripple-licensing
   * primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical analysts
   * primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical desktop
     or eclipse
   * extensible
   * allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis

DEPENDENCIES
   * Python 2.6

COMPONENTS
   * file_determinator.py 
       - identifies file formats, generates metadata
       - status:  90% complete
